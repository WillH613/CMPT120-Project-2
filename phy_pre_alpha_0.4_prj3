		<H2>Periphery</H2>
		<textarea id=gameConsole rows="20" cols="110">You wake from your recurring nightmare only to find your body disconnected; rigid. You cannot move,
stricken with a terrifying bout of sleep paralysis. Peering up at the darkness, unable to make out
your surroundings, the name "Henry Morrison" still fresh in your mind as the nightmare fades and feeling
return to your rigid limbs. 
You awake in an unfamiliar room; one that could have been untouched for fifty years, furnished with a
single photograph on the wall, as the faded, yellow paint peels around it. Aside the antiquated bedframe 
in which you sleep, there is but a single rocking chair and an open, drafty window with shattered panes of
glass, strewn across the sill and upon the floor, which creaks as you stand and head for the door. You 
exit the antiquated shanty into what seems to be a large, winter prairie, lightly dusted in frost and snow.

A single dirt trail traverses from north to south. A single barely discernable road sign can be made out 
to the north.
To the east, the vast, dead prairie continues for what seems to be miles.
To the west, there is a large pine forest.
